Severely Reduced LVEF (<30%). General Appearance: Marked impairment in heart function; Left Ventricle: Poor contractility, potential dilation; Ejection Fraction: Severe systolic dysfunction; Wall Motion: Extensive hypokinesia or akinesia; possible dyskinesia.
Moderately Reduced LVEF (30-44%). General Appearance: Noticeable reduction in heart's pumping ability; Left Ventricle: Significantly decreased contractility; Ejection Fraction: Indicates moderate systolic dysfunction; Wall Motion: Areas of hypokinesia or akinesia may be observed.
Mildly Reduced LVEF (45-54%). General Appearance: Slightly reduced pumping efficiency; Left Ventricle: Contractions are somewhat weaker; Ejection Fraction: Borderline systolic function; Wall Motion: Mild hypokinesia may be present.
Normal LVEF (55-70%). General Appearance: The heart functions efficiently; Left Ventricle: Shows strong and coordinated contractions; Ejection Fraction: Indicates normal systolic function; Wall Motion: Uniform and vigorous.
Hyperdynamic LVEF (>70%). General Appearance: The heart appears to pump vigorously; Left Ventricle: Exhibits very strong contractions; Ejection Fraction: Higher than normal, suggesting increased systolic function; Wall Motion: Hyperkinesia (excessive motion) is evident.
